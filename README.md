# karatsuba_cpp
An implementation of Karatsuba's algorithm for multiplying very large numbers.

This is a common assignment in algorithm courses, and hopefully this provides a helpful resource.

To execute this code, compile and input two integers.  I used gcc to compile.  It works for all numbers I have checked so far.
